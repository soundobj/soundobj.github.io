I have been interested in SVG for a while; its capabilities for responsive design and interactivity are rather attractive. I've set myself the challenge to create a dynamic title for my blog site. I decided for a dynamic neon-like logo. I came up with something like this in Ilustrator:

![illustrator screen shoot]({{ "/img/ilustrator21022015.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})


### Illustrator graphic export


### Shape Reuse

### Filters
